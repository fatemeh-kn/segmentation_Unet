# segmentation_Unet
segmentation of ROI using U-Net
This repository contains projects related to Iron deficiency diagnosis in children using palm images. The main goal of this repository is the automatic segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs), including the palm and fingertips. After segmentation, the images are color-regularized using white balance. In the next step, they are converted from the RGB color space to the CIELab and HSV color spaces. The results are then visualized using plots and images.
